ex1.py: basic plotting
ex2.py: displays how stations are 'snapped' to river networks (you will need to zoom in to see the conencting lines)
ex3.py: Loading stations from shapefiles (don't run, points1.shp and points2.shp don't exist.)
ex4.py: match browser. Load all stations within a specificed lat/lon bounding box and create an nteractive plot allowing the user to click on stations and see a list of matches.
ex5.py: same as ex4, except uses the OHN dataset for rivers.
ex6.py: match array
ex7.py: save to shapefile (no output)
ex8.py: compare station matching between OHN and hydrorivers datasets, calculate the error between the two, and save it to "table.csv"
ex9.py: loading lists of stations from .csv files and saving the station data to .csv files
ex10.py: example of loading large lists of stations from .csv files and matching them.
ex11.py: Load and match stations in "MondayFileGallery/Q_C_pairs.csv", then compare the matches.
